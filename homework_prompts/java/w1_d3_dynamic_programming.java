/**
 *  Homework 05 - Dynamic Programming
 *
 *
 *  Instructions: Dynamic programming takes a lot of practice to recognize as
 *                well as develop algorithms. Thus we will be working on a few
 *                different problems using dynammic programming.
 *
 *                As a reminder, here are the two dynamic programing approaches:
 *
 *      			(1) Overlapping subproblems - Memoization
 *      				  Recursion sometimes call subproblems repeatedly. These repeated
 *                calls lead to inefficient computations and an exponential time
 *                complexity.
 *
 *      			(2) Optimal substructure - Tabulation
 *      					The solution of a larger problem can be solved using
 *      					solutions of its subproblems.

   *  Problem: Lattice Paths (Dynamic Programming Approach)
   *
   *  Prompt:    Count the number of unique paths to travel from the top left
   *             to the bottom right of a lattice of squares.
   *
   *             NOTE: You are traveling along the **EDGES** of the lattice
   *
   *  Input:     An integer N (which is the width of the lattice)
   *             An integer M (which is the height of the lattice)
   *
   *  Output:    An interger (which represents the number of unique paths)
   *
   *  Example:   input: 2
   *
   *             (2 x 3 lattice of squares)
   *              __ __ __
   *             |__|__|__|
   *             |__|__|__|
   *
   *             output: 10 (number of unique paths from top left corner to bottom
   *                     right)
   *
   *             Diagram:
   *
   *             1__1__1__1
   *             |  |  |  |
   *             1__2__3__4
   *             |  |  |  |
   *             1__3__6__10
   *
   *  Notes:     What is the time and auxilliary space complexity of your solution?
   *
   *             When moving through the lattice, you can only move either down or
   *             to the right.
   *
   *             You did this problem before with recursion. Try implementing it
   *             now with dynamic programming!
