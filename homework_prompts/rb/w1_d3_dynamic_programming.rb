#    Homework 05 - Dynamic Programming: Memoization & Tabulation
#
#
#    Instructions: Dynammic programming takes a lot of practice to recognize as
#                  well as develop algorithms. Thus we will be working on a few
#                  different problems using dynammic programming.
#
#                  As a reminder, here are the two dynamic programing approaches:
#
#        			(1) Overlapping subproblems - Memoization
#        				  Recursion sometimes call subproblems repeatedly. These repeated
#                  calls lead to inefficient computations and an exponential time
#                  complexity.
#
#        			(2) Optimal substructure - Tabulation
#        					The solution of a larger problem can be solved using
#        					solutions of its subproblems.
#
#
#

#
#  1a. What are the two main requirements that determine whether a problem can
#      be solved using dynamic programming? Explain what they mean.
#


#
#  1b. What is the top down approach to dynammic programming called?
#


#
#  1c. What is the bottom up approach to dynammic programming called?
#




#  Problem 2: Lattice Paths (Dynamic Programming Approach)
#
#  Prompt:    Count the number of unique paths to travel from the top left
#             to the bottom right of a lattice of squares.
#
#  Input:     An interger N (which is the size of the lattice)
#  Output:    An interger (which represents the number of unique paths)
#
#  Example:   input: 2
#
#             (2 x 2 lattice of squares)
#              __ __
#             |__|__|
#             |__|__|
#
#             output: 6 (number of unique paths from top left corner to bottom
#                     right)
#
#  Notes:     What is the time and auxilliary space complexity of your solution?
#
#             When moving through the lattice, you can only move either down or
#             to the right.
#
#             You did this problem before with recursion. Try implementing it
#             now with dynamic programming!
