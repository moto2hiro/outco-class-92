 *  Homework 05 - Dynamic Programming

 *
 *  Instructions: Dynamic programming takes a lot of practice to recognize as
 *                well as develop algorithms. Thus we will be working on a few
 *                different problems using dynamic programming.

/**
 *  1a. What are the two main requirements that determine whether a problem can
 *      be solved using dynamic programming? Explain what they mean.

 /*
  *  Lattice Paths (Dynamic Programming Approach)
  *
  *  Prompt:    Count the number of unique paths to travel from the top left
  *             to the bottom right of a lattice of squares.
  *
  *             NOTE: You are traveling along the **EDGES** of the lattice
  *
  *  Input:     An integer N (which is the width of the lattice)
  *             An integer M (which is the height of the lattice)
  *
  *  Output:    An interger (which represents the number of unique paths)
  *
  *  Example:   input: 2
  *
  *             (2 x 3 lattice of squares)
  *              __ __ __
  *             |__|__|__|
  *             |__|__|__|
  *
  *             output: 10 (number of unique paths from top left corner to bottom
  *                     right)
  *
  *             Diagram:
  *
  *             1__1__1__1
  *             |  |  |  |
  *             1__2__3__4
  *             |  |  |  |
  *             1__3__6__10
  *
  *  Notes:     What is the time and auxilliary space complexity of your solution?
  *
  *             When moving through the lattice, you can only move either down or
  *             to the right.
  *
  *             You did this problem before with recursion. Try implementing it
  *             now with dynamic programming!
